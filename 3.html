    Hello there?
    Is anyone there?
    Where is.
    Is there anyone?
    To answer me?
    Is anyone there?
    You’re disappearing, more and more, without a sound.
    From me, without any reason.
    Was everything a misunderstanding?
    Were we looking at each other in a dream?
    Why am I alone?
    Among all the people surrounding me.
    Why am I alone?
    I’m all alone, I need someone.
    I need someone right now
  </p>
