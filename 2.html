    Unlike all the other songs in the album, “Afraid” was written by the groups guitarist Sungjin.
    According to Jae, “When we heard it, we’re like, ‘You’re going solo, bro.
    It’s so good.’ It kind of goes back to the roots of Day6.
    It’s a very modern-rock, emotional song, real gritty at the hook.
    Even the lyrics are very pretty.”
    YoungK also mentioned that the song is “[…]
    talking about: ‘I’m afraid I’m taking so many chances in your life.
    I’m taking up your time when it could be better.’ Like I’m no good for you.”
